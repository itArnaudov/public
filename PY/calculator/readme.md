To use the **calculator**:

 1.   Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
 2.   Run the script.
 3.   Follow the on-screen instructions to input two numbers and select the operation.

This is a basic example, and you can extend it with additional features or build a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly calculator app using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.

**v.1.1:**
This updated code includes additional functions for square root, power, and trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan). 
The trigonometric functions use degrees as input, and the `math.radians` function is used to convert degrees to radians before performing the calculations. 
You can further expand the calculator by adding more functions based on your requirements.
