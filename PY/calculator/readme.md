To use the calculator:

    Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., calculator.py).
    Run the script.
    Follow the on-screen instructions to input two numbers and select the operation.

This is a basic example, and you can extend it with additional features or build a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly calculator app using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
