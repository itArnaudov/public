To test the Super Mario Python script, you can follow these steps:

 1.   Install Python:
    If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official Python website.

 2.   Copy the Script:
    Copy the Super Mario script provided in the previous response into a new file with a .py extension, for example, `super_mario.py`.

 3.   Run the Script:
    Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run the script using the following command:

    ```bash

    python super_mario.py
```
    This will execute the script.

 4.   Observe the Output:
    The script will print the levels of Super Mario with Mario's position as he moves to the right. Observe the output in the terminal.

 5.   Follow the Levels:
    The script will simulate Mario moving through the first five levels. Observe how the levels change and Mario's position is updated.

 6.   Completion Message:
    After completing the fifth level, the script will print a "Congratulations" message.

Please note that this script provides a basic text-based simulation of Mario's movement and doesn't include user input for controlling Mario. It's a simple representation for illustrative purposes. If you want to enhance the script or add interactive features, you can modify it accordingly.
