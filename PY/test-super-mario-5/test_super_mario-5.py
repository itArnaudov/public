#This script defines a list of platforms for each level, and Mario's position is updated as he moves to the right. The print_level function is responsible for printing the current state of the level. The script simulates Mario moving through the levels with a slight delay between movements for visual effect. Feel free to modify and expand upon this script for more features and complexity!
